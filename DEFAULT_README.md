Quick start
===========

Preformated:
---------------------------

There are 2 simple way to add code.

1. Simple quote
Just use quote to underline a part of the text.
  Launch `python setup.py install`, or  `source setup.sh`

2. Triple quotes

```python
  class BinaryTree(object):
  """BinaryTree data structure ...
  """
    def __init__(self):
      self._iKey = 0
      self._oLeftTree = None
      self._oRightTree = None
```
This last one allow Syntax highlighting.

List:
-----

1. Simple list:

- keep track and configure your scripts right in `.vimrc`
- [install] configured scripts (aka bundle)
- [update] configured scripts
- [search] by name [all available vim scripts]
- [clean] unused scripts up
- run above actions in a *single keypress* with [interactive mode]

2. Simple list:
I think it is exactly the same than the other.

* allow specify revision/version?
* handle dependencies
* show description in search results
* search by description as well
* make it rock!
